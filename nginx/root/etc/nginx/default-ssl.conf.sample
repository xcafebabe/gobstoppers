    # Session tickets appeared in version 1.5.9
    #
    # nginx does not auto-rotate session ticket keys: only a HUP / restart will do so and
    # when a restart is performed the previous key is lost, which resets all previous
    # sessions. The fix for this is to setup a manual rotation mechanism:
    # http://trac.nginx.org/nginx/changeset/1356a3b9692441e163b4e78be4e9f5a46c7479e9/nginx
    #
    # Note that you'll have to define and rotate the keys securely by yourself. In absence
    # of such infrastructure, consider turning off session tickets:
    #ssl_session_tickets off;

    # Use a higher keepalive timeout to reduce the need for repeated handshakes
